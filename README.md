# GenomicVariation
Evaluate tools and methods for examining statistical variation of the genome over a group of individuals

The source of data is the 1000 Genomes project (http://www.internationalgenome.org)

The approach is to select a target gene, for example amalayse or hemoglobin

Hemoglobin has known variations across the human population (e.g., sickle cell anemia, thassalemia)
Amalyse gene variations are the result of variation in human diets over evolution (amalyse is responsible for converting starches into sugars)

The expected result is that the general level of variation from individual is generally larger than the variation between groups of inviduals when the groups are defined through geographic origin (as in the 1000 Genomes project).  But I can imagine that for some genes this may not be the case and there may be strong geographic alignments.
